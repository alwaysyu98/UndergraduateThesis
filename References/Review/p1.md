# Incremental Maintenance of Maximal Bicliques in a Dynamic Bipartite Graph

## Core Part

Object: MBE, maximal biclique enumeration.

### Theorem 1

Every bipartite graph with n vertices at most $2^{n\over2}$ maximal bicliques, and the only external(maximal) bipartite graphs are the graphs CP(k). (cocktail-party graph)

### Theorem

For a graph G with n vertices, m edges, maximum degree ∆, and number of maximal bicliques μ, there is an algorithm MineLMBC for enumerating maximal bi- cliques in G with time complexity O(n∆μ) and space complexity O(m + ∆2).

## ALGORITHMS FOR MAXIMAL BICLIQUES

Theorem 1 & Theorem 2 both indicate that the new algorithm will be based on them.
